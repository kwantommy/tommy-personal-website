            <p>For 4 years, I was enrolled in biomedical & electrical engineering at McMaster
                University in Hamilton, Ontario. University was a stressful time full of late nights and black coffees.
                I remember,
                for weeks on end, that I would leave my house at 8 in the morning and go home past midnight. The
                seemingly endless coursework, assignments,
                and projects, and When I look back to all
                the courses I took throughout the years, I realize that I could hardly remember some course titles let
                alone the course contents!
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Some of my favourite courses in my undergraduate degree include modelling of biological systems, digital
                signal processing, data
                structures and algorithms, programming, microprocessor systems, and logic design.
            </p>

            <p>The friends you make in university are special; after all, they are the ones who you spent countless
                hours
                complaining to about courses.
            </p>

            <p>The biggest takeaway from my university career is <em></em>learning how to learn.</em> There's absolutely
                no
                way (well, except for Some
                geniuses that I know), to be able to learn everything in every course. How to connect dots, how to make
                friends, laerning to bounce back.

            <p> One day, I plan on going back to school and completing a Master's in biomedical engineering or computer
                science.
