                            <h4>A tale of my university journey from beginning to end and the key things I learned
                                along the way.</h4>

                            <p style="margin-top: 40px;">University is full of late nights and black coffees. It's easy
                                to get lost in the piles of assignments and deadlines. I learned many lessons along the
                                way that I want to share and that I wish I knew during my journey. </p>

                            <h4 class="content-title">Learning How To Learn</h4>

                            <p>If you asked me a question from my first year calculus course right now, there is
                                absolutely
                                no way I'd remember how to do it. Heck, even if you asked me a week after the exam,
                                there is probably just a slim
                                chance I'd be able to do the question. </p>


                            <p>The key thing I learned from university is how to learn. For me, lectures by themselves
                                were
                                insufficient. However, I found that reading the supplementary notes or assignments
                                connected many of the dots during lecture that I had missed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On top of this, I found that the programming way of thought was very effective to my
                                learning. By breaking down lectures into smaller pieces similar to breaking down code
                                into individual sections, I found that I was able to absorb information much more efficiently.
                            </p>


                            <h4 class="content-title">Find What Makes You Productive</h4>
                            <p>
                                As a person that is easily distracted by <em><strong>anything</strong></em>, it was
                                important for me to find an effective way to get into the working and productive zone.
                                I found that I was the most productive at a libraries as seeing others working forces me
                                to
                                work as well. The library cannot be too loud, but also not too quiet as to be able to
                                hear conversations. Low volume non-hip-hop music also helped me concentrate. Also, it is
                                important to have a
                                goal
                                on what you want to finish (for example, how many chapters to study)
                                in your work session.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="content-title">Prevent Burnout</h4>
                            <p>
                                Although school is non-stop homework and assignments, it is important to prevent burnout
                                by taking your mind off school. I wish I had taken burnout more seriously as it severely
                                hindered my performance and clouded my ability to learn. Always find time to do things
                                you love such as learning an
                                instrument or watch a couple of episodes of your favourite show.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="content-title">You (Most Likely) Cannot Do It Yourself</h4>

                            <p>My friends were a large part in keeping me sane during my university journey. As you and
                                your friends laugh about how impossible a certain question or assignment is, you gain a
                                sense of relief that you are not the only one struggling. By working with others, you
                                gain much more perspective than working by yourself. Friends make the end just that much
                                sweeter as they went through the same journey as you. </p>

                            <h4 class="content-title">Only You Know You</h4>
                            <p> No one knows you better than yourself. Only you know what you can and cannot do. Don't
                                kick yourself down. If you fall, pick yourself back up because tomorrow is a new day!
